It will spawn motion and a simple express server to view the cam.\r\n\r\n  * It can use a JSON file that represents a .conf file ([see configs](https://github.com/j3lte/node-motion/tree/master/config))\r\n  * It can use a valid motion.conf file (see [examples](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WorkingConfigs))\r\n  * It uses a JSON file in `config/` ([see example config](https://github.com/j3lte/node-motion/blob/master/config/motion_conf.json)) to create a temporary `motion.conf` file. Values can be overridden with the client\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nInstall Node.js if you don't have it yet. Then from the command line:\r\n\r\n    [sudo] npm install node-motion -g\r\n\r\nThen proceed as follows:\r\n\r\n    node-motion [options] [configfile]\r\n\r\nSee [client output](https://github.com/j3lte/node-motion/blob/master/docs/cli.md)\r\n\r\nPrerequisites\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n* Only works on Linux (tested and developed on Ubuntu 14.04 & Raspberry Pi)\r\n* Needs the motion package installed (`sudo apt-get install motion`), currently works on:\r\n    * Motion version 3.2.12\r\n    * Motion version 3.2.12+git20140228\r\n\r\n## Bugs / issues / features\r\n\r\nPlease, if you find any bugs, or are a way better developer than I am (as in, you are thinking 'spaghetti' when looking at my code), feel free to create an issue. If you have features or addons for compatibility, please add a [pull request](https://github.com/j3lte/node-motion/pulls)!\r\n\r\n## [License](https://github.com/j3lte/node-motion/blob/master/LICENSE)\r\n\r\n(The MIT License)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2015 Jelte Lagendijk <jwlagendijk@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
